This year I decided to just use Odin for all problems and break all the arbitrary rules I set for myself in the previous years.
Among them include:
   - reading only from stdin instead of using file IO (which I originally did out of convenience more or less anyways, but Odin's os.read_entire_file() makes it much easier to just do that always)
   - editing the solution to part 1 to produce both part 1 and part 2
I now just read input.txt and i section parts 1 and 2 off, copying code from 1 into 2 when i feel like, not even bothering to pull things out into functions most of the time
This leads to more code overall and looks a lot less elegant with all the copy-pasting but i get the problems done faster so who really cares
